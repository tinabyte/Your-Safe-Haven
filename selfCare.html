<h2>Why you should practice Self-Care</h2>

<p> In a society where there are constant work or something that has to be done. We often times overwork ourselves in exchange to get ahead in our tasks. I am alway guilty of this. When I am coding, I barely look at the clock and never notice the damage done throughout a 7 hour coding session. Yes, we do get ahead on our work… In the short term. Our health deteriorates and that causes our work quality to drop as well. However, maintaining a simple self-care schedule for yourself will not only lead to your overall happiness, but also your work efficiency. Don’t we all want to glow and not look like dead zombies? YES.
 </p>


<h2>Some ways to Self-Care</h2>
<p>
  1. Get regular exercise. Just 30 minutes of walking every day can help boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do 30 minutes at one time.
</p>

<p>
 2. Eat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated. A balanced diet and plenty of water can improve your energy and focus throughout the day. Also, limit caffeinated beverages such as soft drinks or coffee.
</p>

<p>
3. Make sleep a priority. Stick to a schedule, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Blue light from devices and screens can make it harder to fall asleep, so reduce blue light exposure from your phone or computer before bedtime.
</p>

<p>
 4. Try a relaxing activity. Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy such as journaling.
</p>

<p>
5. Set goals and priorities. Decide what must get done now and what can wait. Learn to say “no” to new tasks if you start to feel like you’re taking on too much. Try to be mindful of what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do.
</p>

<p>
  6. Practice gratitude. Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down at night, or replay them in your mind.
Focus on positivity. Identify and challenge your negative and unhelpful thoughts.
</p>

<p>
  7. Stay connected. Reach out to your friends or family members who can provide emotional support and practical help.
  </p>

<p> 8. Hang out with friends with positive affirming "energy"</p>

<p> 9. Meditate</p>

<p> 10. Having your schedule organize can also help with your overall clarity and focus</p>
